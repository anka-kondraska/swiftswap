SwiftSwap

Description:
When bartering, its hard to find what you want from the person who will barter for the skill you have. SwiftSwap searches the user network to find a closed path between users which means every user gets access to the skill they want without a one to one exchange. SwiftSwap utilizes a NetworkX method of finding elementary circuits based on Johnson's algorithm called simple_cycles. It locates a closed loop where the beginning and ending of the path is the same user.
